A file system explorer gives us the possibility of displaying different types of properties for different types of files.
We bear in mind that in Linux, everything is a file, so this is the base class. Every other type of file will derive from
the base File class. The Visitor pattern allows us to add different types of Files without making changes difficult to
maintain. All we need to do is add functions for visiting and visitable for the newly added object.

As a basic use case, we are going to consider some txt files, image files and directories. Of course, we can add multiple
types of files in the future without much trouble.

For implementing this design pattern we are going to add the operation we want to apply as a Visitor argument, in our
case, FileVisitor: void accept(FileVisitor visitor). This way, we will be able to process the display operation on different
variations of File elements.

If we wish to add more types of files, one should only add another visit method in FileVisitor and implement it accordingly.
